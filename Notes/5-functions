We can delay a function call to the end of the current scope by using the defer keyword. 
defer tells Go to run a function, but at the end of the current function. This is useful for logging, file writing, and other utilities.

Normally, we would consider adding fmt.Println("Taxes Calculated!") at the end of calculateTaxes(). 
But, we have multiple return statements in our code, instead of adding a print statement right before each return, we use defer and it prints regardless of when our function ends.
